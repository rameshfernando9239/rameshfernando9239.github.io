**Graduate Student**  
*Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD)*  
*Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD)*

Hello!  
I am a graduate student at Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), pursuing my Master's degree in Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD). My research interests lie in the intersection of computer architecture and machine learning, with a focus on developing novel techniques for energy-efficient computing. As a researcher, I am particularly interested in exploring the potential of machine learning to improve the performance and efficiency of computing hardware specifically domain specific architectures (DSA).

I recived my Master of Science (MSc.) degree in Computer Science from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2024. My thesis was focused on *Cloud Computing and EDA (Electronic Design Automation): Cost Optimization for
the EDA Jobs With Object Storage*.
